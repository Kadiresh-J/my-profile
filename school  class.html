<h1>School Classes</h1>
<p>I miss my school for only 1  reason and that is friends.
  when there was school we would have fun in break and lunch time.
  we would  also have P.T. and our favourite sport is cricket and maths
  period would  be 8 periods in a weak, I am good in maths and got 98 in 
  first term exam. In school we would have trip and I like sports day and I 
  miss it because of the impact of covid-19 and even we would have science 
  and  social day and the other activities like childre's days teachers
  dance  and mainly cricket
