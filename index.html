<p>My name is Sanjay Shrinivasan, I like to play Cricket, I am interested to learn about 
Computers and I am a fan of M.S.Dhoni. I started learning html commands and I
 also wrote 2 stories and I began 3rd one. I was going for coaching but didn't
 go from 8 months due to the impact of covid-19, we have online classes, my favourite
 subject is Maths and Physics. </p>
