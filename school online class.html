    <h1>school online class</h1>
    <p>According to me online class is best and easy and less potions
     and only 3 to 4 periods, and only 50 minutes period but before
      it was 40 minutes period and my favourite suubject is 
    <br>Maths
    <br>physics 
    <br> and I love to do algebra sums. At last I say "is online class is best"   </p>
