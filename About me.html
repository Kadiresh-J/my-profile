<p>My name is sanjay, I like to play cricket and also I want to learn about 
computers and I am a fan of MS Dhoni. I started learning html commands and i
 also wrote 2 stories and I started 3rd one. Im going for coaching but did'nt
 go from 8 months because of corona and we have online class  and my favourite
 subject is maths and physics and also want to play cricket but could'nt
 play. so full 8 months didnt play cricket </p>
