            Then we came to an island and when we went there there was a masaging center but we didnt go
            there and we saw a shop, we bought some fish and I ate an icecream, after eating it we saw a
            motor boat and had a ride, we went to the boathouse, after 2 hours they stopped the boat and
            we went to see the other place where people lived and we came back, had a good sleep and
            next morning we went back to the place and had almost 20 hours in Boathouse.
